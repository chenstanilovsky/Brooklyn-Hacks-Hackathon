### This was my team's submission for Brooklyn Hacks 2020

Our goal was to make a website that contained resources for homeless residents of NYC. The website was designed with the idea of hosting it on a touch based kiosk. Therefore, the website was designed to be touch friendly. For the map, we used Google Maps API in order to create the image and place marker on the map which represetned locations of interest.

Creating the markers for the map was difficult. It used data from NYC Open Data which was not uniform. The use of multiple data set required some clever way to process the data using the same method. We used a map to map information that was useful, like addresses or telephone numbers, to the location where it could be found in the data. In this way, it allowed us to use a single method to process the data.
